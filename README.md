## T-Basis: a Compact Representation for Neural Networks 

<img src="doc/teaser.png" align="left" width="33%">

This repository is the official implementation of our ICML 2020 paper titled "T-Basis: a Compact Representation for 
Neural Networks" 
[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06631) 
[[PMLR]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/obukhov20a.html). 

It demonstrates how to perform low-rank neural network training in a compressed form. 
The code provides select experiments (image classification and semantic segmentation) from the paper (see 
`configs/icml20` directory).

## Installation and Datasets

Clone the repository, then create a new virtual environment, and install python dependencies into it:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv_tbasis
source venv_tbasis/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

In case of problems with generic requirements, fall back to 
[requirements_reproducibility.txt](doc/requirements_reproducibility.txt).

## Logging

The code performs logging to the console, tensorboard file in the experiment log directory, and also Weights and Biases 
(wandb). Upon the first run, please enter your wandb credentials, which can be obtained by registering a free account 
with the service.

## Creating Environment Config

The training script allows specifying multiple `yml` config files, which will be concatenated during execution. 
This is done to separate experiment configs from environment configs. 
To start running experiments, create your own config file with a few environment settings, similar to 
[configs/env_lsf.yml](configs/env_lsf.yml). Generally, you only need to update paths; see other fields explained in 
[config reference](doc/config.md).

## Training

Choose a preconfigured experiment from any of the `configs/icml20/*` directories, or compose your own config 
using the [config reference](doc/config.md), and run the following command:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m src.train --cfg configs/env_yours.yml --cfg configs/experiment.yml
```
